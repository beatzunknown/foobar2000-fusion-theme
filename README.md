# foobar2000-theme

## About this theme
Fundamentally this theme is the Fusion v2.4.1.1 (Beta) theme for foobar2000, by nadirp on DeviantArt.

I added some very minor aesthetic changes which I honestly can't remember at this point. The ones I can recall are:
* Changed "Fusion Beta" text of "foobar2000"
* Changed some of the padding around the "current playing" album art & metadata in the bottom left.

## Installation
1. Copy the contents of the `components` folder into your `components` folder in the foobar2000 directory.
2. Copy the `Fusion` folder into your `themes` folder in the foobar2000 directory.
3. Go to foobar2000 Preferences > Display > Default User Interface > Import Theme, and import `Fusion.fth` in the `Fusion` folder that you now have copied in your `themes` folder.
