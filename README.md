# My foobar2000 Themes

## Fusion

### About this theme

Fundamentally this theme is the Fusion v2.4.1.1 (Beta) theme for foobar2000, by nadirp on DeviantArt.

I added some very minor aesthetic changes which I honestly can't remember at this point. The ones I can recall are:

* Changed "Fusion Beta" text of "foobar2000"
* Changed some of the padding around the "current playing" album art & metadata in the bottom left.

### Installation

1. Copy the contents of the `components` folder into your `components` folder in the foobar2000 directory.
2. Copy the `Fusion` folder into your `themes` folder in the foobar2000 directory.
3. Go to foobar2000 Preferences > Display > Default User Interface > Import Theme, and import `Fusion.fth` in the `Fusion` folder that you now have copied in your `themes` folder.

## Simple Themes

These are just my simpler themes which don't require UIHacks, JScript or Spider Monkey panels etc. Fusion theme might look great and modern but it's hardcoded to bits and extremely inflexible. It's gotten annoying not being able to have playlists with custom-ordering due to the forced "sort-by" filter being applied, so here we are.

Currently there are 2 simple themes:

* Old n Simple - so barebones it's almost like foobar2000 in its default state. But I've got a soft spot for it since it was my first attempt at customisation many years ago.

* Daily Driver - what I use now. It's got everything I need: playlist window, album art, library window, lyrics, waveform seekbar, spectrogram and playback queue.
